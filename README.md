# Voting-Algorithms
A consensus protocol that tolerates participant failures. The protocol involves two types of processes: a coordinator, whose role is to initiate a run of the consensus algorithm and collect the outcome of the vote; and a participant, which contributes a vote and communicates with the other participants to agree on an outcome.
